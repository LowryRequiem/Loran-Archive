Last year, I decided to start writing a blog, the original Loran Lounge. It was a creative project to allow myself a place to talk about some of my favourite pieces of media, in a form that didn't demand as much dedication as creating Youtube video essays, or managing a social media page with short form content.

Ultimately, the project fell apart. I thoroughly enjoyed writing some of the pieces, but I set unnecessary goals on myself, starting trying to meet arbitrary deadlines, and resultantly started making content that my heart wasn't in - leading me to abandon the project.

All in all, what I was looking for was some sort of space to extend my creative interests to. A place where I could talk about the games or shows that interested me, a place where I could share my ideas and allow people to connect with them, a place where I could share my creative writings and other such projects. A place that was my own to cultivate, where one could come to, get comfy, and delve into what common interests we may share, and leave feeling enriched the way pieces of media leave me time and time again - that feeling of transient wonder, the high one gets after finishing a story, a high that leaves you wanting to create yourself, to leave a mark in others the way you have just been marked.

Just me? Maybe. Either way, I feel as though *this* may be the solution I've been seeking. [[Anna Howard - creating a digital garden to end my doomscrolling\|When I heard about digital gardening a month or two ago]] - I was hesitant. I've been removing myself from socials and other such cyclical elements of the internet as of late, and following some new trend didn't quite feel as though it was going to do me any favours. However, as time crept along, I found myself returning to the concept time and time again, and began to realise that it may be the solution to a multitude of the problems I've been facing. I've been wanting to leave my mark and gather my thoughts, writings and ideas? What better way to do it than through the cultivation of a digital garden.

So here we are, Loran Lounge. I decided to keep the imagined cafÃ© aesthetic - not out of any particular love for coffee, but moreso to capture the cosy feeling of wandering into a third space, cradling a nice warm mug, and having a read or a write - both on your own terms, but also surrounded by those of similar intent. So please, explore the lounge, find something that resonates with you, whatever it may be, and let us share in that aforementioned enrichment. Come and go as you please, as will I, and let your interests guide you. 

Have a good one :)

P.S. - here is the tutorial I used to actually make this site if anybody is interested in making their own! -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f8e5IiUkeo&t=348s&ab_channel=Wanderloots
