# Pantheon Overview: Gods of Reign
## üìÉ Summary

Amidst the Age of Conception, after Yore had united the Gods via the Pantheon of Order, the Primeval God of Control, Vira, seized power and started a rebellion amongst the Gods. This rebellion would begin the Aeon of Conflict, and permanently sever the Gods into two groups - one of order, and one of reign.
## üìú Gods of the Pantheon

- ü©∏ **Vira**: Primeval God of Control. 
	- The initiator of the rebellion, and ruler of the Pantheon of Reign, Vira is a being who cares not about the means of her creation, only that she has been created, and amidst such an act has been granted the ability to seize that which surrounds her. Caring not for the threat of ruin, she dances about fate, clawing at what prizes she can. She is a God after all, why dedicate one's existence to a mere concept that did nothing more than allow her own existence?
- ‚ùì **Morn**: Primeval God of Meaning.
	- A being cursed to determine the meaning of all things, yet doomed to never understand the meaning of its own existence, Morn rejected the banality of Yore's proposed maintenance of faith, and instead opted to side with the Pantheon of Reign to at least have something interesting to discern meaning from.
- üçÉ **Dane**: Primeval God of Change
	- Dane, similar to Lyma, is the strategist of the Pantheon of Reign and lives to throw spanners in the works of plans and to spark chaos where there is calm. Not necessarily evil in nature, he rejected Yore's strive for order and preferred Vira's embrace of change.
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Icor**: Primeval God of Conflict
	- From their conception, Icor was tasked to spawn conflict between beings. They did not ask for this fate, and while they wished, truly, that they could side with Yore, they know that to strive for his cause would be to defy their own existence.
- ‚ö∞Ô∏è **Evon**: Primeval God of Eventuality
	- Vira's trump card, the God who could end the otherwise infinite stalemate of the Aeon of Conflict. Evon was created to deem an end to all things, eternal proof that there is no infinite truly, that every means has an ends, that every snake, swallows its tail.
