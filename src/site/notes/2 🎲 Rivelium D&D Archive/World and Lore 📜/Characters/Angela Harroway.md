## 📃 Summary

From a druidic halfling clan that wanders the Mosaile Wood - an enchanted forest that sits outside Aelfhelum. Angela has spent most of her life in the wild, and has spent a considerable amount of time in her wild shaped form.

It wasn't until she met the fleeing Douglas and Blue that she felt the kick to explore beyond the wood, learning that life was so different in other parts of the realm.
