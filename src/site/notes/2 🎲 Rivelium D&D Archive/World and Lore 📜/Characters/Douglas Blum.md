## 📃 Summary

After fooling an elven family into adopting him, Douglas was eventually found out to be human, and shipped off to a boarding school that focused on scholarly wizarding. 

Here, he became a proficient spellcaster, and as he had little friends due to being a human amongst elves, he spent all his spare time working out.

After graduating, he started an internship at Vilios Academy, and was placed in a postal warehouse on the outskirts of Aelfhelum and Yanaviere. However, after discovering and befriending Blue, he realised that Vilios Academy was performing experiments on people and creatures. Together, they broke out and fled from the warehouse and began travelling as lone adventurers.
### 🧠 Personality and Motives

Bold and unintentionally charming, Douglas is a friendly, dopey giant. Finally free from the judgemental reigns of elven academia, he is happy to find his place in the world, and protect his newly acquired friends.
