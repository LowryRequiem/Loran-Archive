## 🎲 The Pullovers Paradox - Current Campaign

Set in the Age of Anarchy, and following the events of the Fall of Flammenvielen, the Pullovers Paradox follows a band of unlikely adventurers who become bound by Hexes - an enigmatic, emergent magic phenomenon that grant seemingly ordinary individuals fate shifting and reality bending powers. Chasing a purple rift that has torn open in the sky above Ashrun Valley, they follow an unseen mystical pull to adventure - uncovering secret plots behind the Vanalor elections, and the sudden fall of one of Rivelium's most powerful cities.
