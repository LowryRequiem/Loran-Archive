# Pantheon Overview: Gods of Order

## 📃 Summary

During the Age of Conception, the Primeval Gods were created by the Primordial Concepts. The first of these, Yore, would go on to unite the Gods and form the Pantheon of Order - a collective of the first Primeval Gods who sought to supervise the weaving of fate at the behest of the Primordial Concept of Fate.
## 📜 Gods of the Pantheon

- ⚖️ **[[1.2 🎲 Rivelium Archive/World and Lore 📜/Gods/Yore\|Yore]]**: Primeval God of Justice
	- Yore is the leader and judicator of the pantheon, guiding his fellow Gods and respective followers, and ensuring that order is kept, and ruin is avoided.
- 💭 **Lyma**: Primeval God of Wonder
	- Lyma is both the strategist and lead creator of the pantheon, child-like in nature, their wonderings have spawned cosmos of creation. However, their thoughts often run off and spawn problems for the rest of the pantheon to deal with - oftentimes creating entire new Gods themselves that at times have become allies, and other times adversaries.
- 🌌 **Zeya**: Primeval God of Essence
	- Energy flows from Zeya's form like a fountain, and is responsible for the vast magic that the pantheon has been able to weave and utilise. Likewise, the Pantheon of Reign have also at times siphoned this energy. Zeya's very being is an incomprehensible force of equal creation and devastation - to no fault of her own.
- 🪨 **Leor**: Primeval God of Materiality
	- Unlike the rest, Leor is adverse to collaboration and seeks to exist on his own. Made of constantly shifting, corroding, and reforming mass - he is a moving being of might. He only remains with the pantheon out of respect for Yore, and moreso disdain for Vira, who he knows would only seek to manipulate him.
- 🕒 **Ator**: Primeval God of Time
	- Indifference is the best word to sum up Ator. An eternally long, snake-like creation, Ator traverses the infinite weave of energy that borders the very fabric of reality. If he were to ever stop, so would time itself. This is his only purpose, yet he aligns with the Pantheon of Order. They are unsure why, though they know if Vira were to ever grow so daring as to try seize time itself, that they would all know the true wrath of Ator.
