## üìÉ Summary

Yore was among the first Primeval Gods to be created by the Primordial Concept of Fate. Within him, the Primordial buried the will to guide and weave fate itself, combating its very flux through the imposition of justice and order. 

Yore guided the Primeval Gods and formed the Pantheon of Order. As its strict judicator, he allowed the Primeval Gods to go about their ways but ensured to keep them in line as such that things would not lead to ruin.

This would go awry however, when Vira, the Primeval God of Control, would attempt to usurp his position - leading to the formation of the Pantheon of Reign.

Amidst the Aeon of Conflict, Yore would create Grayas, the Herald of Order, to attempt to parlay with the forces of reign. Grayas was stoic and passionate, yet flawed. The forces of reign swayed him to believe that there could not be order, without first chaos, and believing this, Grayas returned to Yore conflicted, drawn between chaos and order.

Understanding his mistake, Yore forgave Grayas, and understood his dilemma. In order to allow Grayas to come to his own conclusion, he forged mortal life - humans, modelling them after the same conflict which plagued Grayas. Grayas would therefore observe his kin, and understand through them as they too fought between the order and chaos.

As the Aeon of Conflict shifted gears into the Great Planar Struggle, Yore and the rest of the pantheon realised that the material realm would not outlast their wars. As a result, they proposed allowing their mortal kin to occupy the plane instead, implementing the Pact of Alyss, and ushering in the Age of Yore Reckoning.
