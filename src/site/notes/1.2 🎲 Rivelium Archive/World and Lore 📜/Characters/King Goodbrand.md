## 📃 Summary

Born in 641 YR, Ingalthur was the oldest son of the Goodbrand family and king of Vanalor and Rivelium during the Age of Good. The Goodbrands were well off farmers who owned land in the northern regions of Vanalor. Ingalthur was raised on the farms but joined the Yoresmen Guild of the Faith once he came of age. Here, he trained as a paladin of [[1.2 🎲 Rivelium Archive/World and Lore 📜/Gods/Yore\|Yore]], and gained the favour of many for his charisma and kind heart.

His legacy came to be during the Threefold Rebellion, where after the head paladin of the guild, Arek Stormwar (who Ingalthur was squire of at the time) fell, Ingalthur was promoted to stand in his place.

At the Clash of Three Kings, Ingalthur fought Lord Lavandra alongside the then rulers of Flammenvielen and the Miracullum Coast. In a moment which did not go according to plan, Ingalthur dealt the finishing blow to Lord Lavandra, citing himself as the successor of the Pact of Alyss. The ruler of Flammenvielen sought to overrule this, but the ruler of the coast bent the knee, as did many others who admired Ingalthur's heart and spirit. This crowned him the new king, and ushered in the Age of Good.

King Goodbrand would usher in an age of progression and modernity, however would be prematurely severed from his throne during the Feast of Knives, where his legacy came to an abrupt end.
