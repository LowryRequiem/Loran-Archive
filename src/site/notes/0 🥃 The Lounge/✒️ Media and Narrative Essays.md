# ✒️ Have a Read of my Media Essays!

I play a lot of games and consume a lot of media, and oftentimes have a lot to say about them. So here, I'll be posting some of my personal, and academic essays, where I talk about some of my favourite games and media.

Hopefully you will find some resonance with them, and through my writings, feel the same sort of inspiration that they inflected onto me. Enjoy!
