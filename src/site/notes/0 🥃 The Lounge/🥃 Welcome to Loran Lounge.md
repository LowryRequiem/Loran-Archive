## 🍀About the Owner

That'd be me! My name is Aaron Lowry, and I'm an Irish writer, dungeon master, aspiring creative director and all round media enthusiast. I'm currently undergoing a masters degree in comparative literature, focusing particularly on media and games studies, and am working on a few personal creative projects - such as my first novel, *New Gods of the Old Religion*!
