Flammenvielen has fallen, and as its citizens venture out into the rest of the continent in search of salvation and hope, a select few adventurers find their stories inexplicably interwoven, led solely by an enigmatic *pull* of fate.

A mere series of coincidences? Or something much, much bigger than themselves? The Pullovers Paradox follows the unlikely story of B, Ember, Lyra and Xolo as they venture into the south of the continent in search of answers, purple rifts, and really good, *real* food.
