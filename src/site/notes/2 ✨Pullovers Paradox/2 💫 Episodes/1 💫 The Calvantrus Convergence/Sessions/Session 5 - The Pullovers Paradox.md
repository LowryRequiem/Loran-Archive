# üå©Ô∏è An Unusual Storm

The party awake on their last day in Calvantrus to an usual storm. Rain lashes and lightning cracks outside, a nearly impossible phenomenon for the dry climate surrounding Flammenvielen. The party attempt to spy on the source of the storm, peering in the skies back towards Flammenvielen, and notice pink sparks in the clouds, suspecting that there may be an arcane aspect to this storm. Xolo decides to taste the rain, noting it doesn't taste like normal rain, further bloating their theories.

The whole ordeal leads the party to question the climate of Flammenvielen, and they wonder where Flammenvielen even gets their water from in the first place?
### üëã Departing Calvantrus

The party head out into town on what is to be their last day in Calvantrus. They arrive at the market square for the announcement of the winner of the armband game, which Lyra wins by a landslide from stealing so many children's armbands, and then head to The Lott and The Black Shore one last time to acquire bits from Sheila and Vander.

B acquires some scrap off Vander while interrogating him on where he got his prosthetic arm, learning of an establishment in the criminal city of Wallrun, The Kettlelamp, where they deal in robotic parts and pieces. The conversation shifts to B herself, and her involvement in Operation Chaos Theory - the bombings and raidings of Flammenvielen's outer districts that distracted the city's military and allowed for the Usurper Choir siege to take place. B is abrasive about the topic, and eventually leaves the place.

Before returning to the departing carts, the party swing in to The Lott to say a final goodbye to their beloved friend, Sheila Harpey. B and Sheila exchanges gifts, and the party are given a sending stone by her so that they can keep in touch.
## Joining the Exodus

The party eventually get back to where the carts are departing from, and link back up with Davos and his two tortoises, Deirdre and Dundee, before heading off towards Lake Gheel Cross with the rest of the procession.

Lorna decides to travel with them for the time being while she is still recovering, and joins them in the cart with Davos as they take off along the Dry Road.

As they travel, the wildlife slowly becomes increasingly green and livelier as they distance themselves from Flammenvielen, and they casually chat with Davos amidst the procession of carts, learning of his history at the Gun Coast, and how he found Deirdre and Dundee on an uncharted island during his pirating days.

During this time, Lyra approaches B after overhearing the conversation at The Black Shore, and B reveals bits about her past involvements. Soon after, B gets to work on a contraption that can safely store the Everflame core they have stolen, while Xolo brews up potions for everyone.
### üåå The Dawning of the Purple Rift

As they are travelling, the storm above worsens, and suddenly, a sharp bolt of lighting shoots across the sky - ripping open an astronomically large purple rift above the procession, high into the sky. The valley is suddenly dimly lit in a lilac hue, and before they have a chance to process what this rift may be, a light flashes from Lorna as a mysterious sigil is suddenly branded onto the side of her torso where her arm used to be - a sigil that bears a strange resemblance to the one that Xolo and Ember observed in Kraetor's eye only a day earlier.
