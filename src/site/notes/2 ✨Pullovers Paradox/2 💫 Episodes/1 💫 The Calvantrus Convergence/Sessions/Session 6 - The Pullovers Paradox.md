# ‚ö° Beneath the Purple Rift

The party continue to travel beneath the purple rift, and spend time investigating it while they travel along the Dry Road. The rain that pours from it appears to have a purple shimmer to it too, and gives off an aura of conjuration magic. The rain is relentless at this stage, and the fissure in the sky continues to grow, seemingly moving southward.

Around them all, little pink spores appear to float around that are being spawned from the droplets. Over the course of a few days as they travel, the rain does not cease, and the spores and droplets begin to replace the surrounding flora with strange, cosmic variants that appear not from this plane.
### üîé Investigating the Brand

Xolo also spends some time trying to identify the mysterious brand that has suddenly appeared on Lorna, discovering that it is of a different magic type than any they are used to. The brand mystifies Xolo, lulling him into a trance as he attempts to magically identify it further.
### üî• Ember's Mark

One of the nights that they are travelling, Ember dreams of the Everflame core that they carry, and envisions a purple hand seizing it, the energy from it being siphoned, split and rippled.

Awaking from this dream, Ember finds a a sigil similar to both Kraetor and Lorna's branded onto the palm of her hand. The pair spend the next few days investigating their brands, and begin to learn how to harness whatever magic is within them. 

Lorna is the first to figure this out, discovering that she can now dissipate her remaining arm into a bright mist, and is able to reform this mist through the mark of her missing arm into other forms. She begins to practice dissipating her right arm, to make a blade out of her left. Meanwhile, Ember practices using her mark on the Everflame core, and is able to just barely grip onto the flame magically, but is unsure what this means just yet.
### üëã The Neighbouring Party

Next to the party in the procession, is another carting adventuring party. They begin to chat with them and learn their names - the tabaxi driver, Tammy, a buff human named Douglas, a white-haired halfling Angela, and a large, swollen looking orc of sorts named Blue. 

They chat with this adventuring party who they learn are headed to Wallrun in search of work. As they do, they convince Douglas to snort some powder made up of the purple floating spores that they have collected. This causes his eyes to glow a little purple, and slightly alters his magical output, making his casts glow purple.
#### üß¨ Vilios Academy and Biological Experiments

They question the party further, and learn that Douglas had broken Blue out of an experimentation facility, and then met Angela while they were on the run. The facility was working on race splicing, hence why he looks as if he is an amalgamation of an orc and a toad. The party suspect that their changeling / elf friend Sheila is a result of a similar experiment.

Douglas explains how he studied wizardry in Aelfhelum, and was working an internship of sorts with the Vilios Academy when he discovered the facility that held Blue. This facility was not run by the Vilios Academy, but by an organisation that was at least in leagues with them, and was located somewhere between Aelfhelum and Yanaviere.
### üå± Diverging through the Marsh

After hearing word that there is some sort of militia checkpoint ahead of the procession, the party urge Davos to find an alternative way around in fear of Lorna or the Everflame core being discovered. As such, Davos takes a shortcut that will take them briefly through a neighbouring marshland and out toward Lake Gheel Cross.

They set up for the night somewhat into the marsh, and take to sleep while Davos tells a spooky story of an island he once discovered that was haunted by doppelgangers. 
### ‚ùì Missing Conductors

The next morning, the party wake up surrounded by spores and distorted flora and fungi that has entrapped the cart overnight. As they attempt to get the cart moving, Davos attempts to contact the rest of the procession conductors via sending stone, and cannot get into contact with anyone strangely. He eventually reaches someone, who exclaims that a large portion of the procession had gone missing at the militia checkpoint, that some of them were let through, but those who were stopped had wound up missing, with no sign of the militia left behind.
