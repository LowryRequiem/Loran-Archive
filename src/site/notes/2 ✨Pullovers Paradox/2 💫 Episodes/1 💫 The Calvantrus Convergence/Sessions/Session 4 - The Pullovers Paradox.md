# üåÑ Morning at The Passer's Buy

The party awake and gather after the intensity of the previous night, and plan what is to be their last day in Calvantrus. They console the crippled Usurper Choir elf, Lorna, and allow her to stay in their room while she heals.

After this, they depart into the streets once more, planning on visiting a few shops and chat with a few individuals before setting off.
### üî• Kraetor Militia Leaving

As the party make their way to The Lott, they notice that Kraetor and his guards are packing up to leave. Ember and Xolo decide to speak with Kraetor, knowing that their involvement in the attacks on the convoy are still not known by him, and discover that he and his crew are now headed to Yanaviere instead of their original plan to head to Aelfhelum, due to the complications spurred for them at Calvantrus over the last few days.

During this encounter, the pair spy a strange sigil branded into Kraetor's eye, unlike anything they have seen before. 
#### ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Ember's History

The encounter spurs Ember to reveal to the party the reason in which she left Flammenvielen and is wary of Kraetor and his men. She explains that her mother was a researcher for the Flammenvielen military, and that her father and brother are both battlemages for them also. 

After conducting independent research on the origin of the Everflame, Ember's mother was fired from her role as researcher, and soon after died in a tragic accident. Since then, Ember has found a letter detailing her mother's research, and has chosen to continue it in her stead. 

Soon after she took on this decision, an attempt was made on Ember's life that made her realise that Flammenvielen truly was keeping something about the Everflame concealed. She left the castle after this, and soon after, the siege on Flammenvielen had begun, leading her to join the mass exodus.
### üê≤ Meeting with Mayor Bronwyn

After briefly popping into Sheila at The Lott to discuss about Yanaviere, learning a little about it's mysterious inhabitants and more importantly, Sheila's old spider friend Mary - the party decide to take up Mayor Bronwyn on her previous offer of tea and head to her place.

They are let in by a doorman and are greeted by Bronwyn and her pet dragon wyrmling Lincoln in her finely adorned, antique home. She tells the party how since the fall of the Lavandra dragon riders, dragons are practically extinct and are exceedingly rare to see on the material plane. The only reason she is allowed to keep Lincoln, is because his wings were clipped a long time ago, preventing him from growing past the stage of wyrmling.

They talk over tea and learn that Bronwyn comes from a wealthy family of dragonborn landowners and business moguls who mainly reside in the Nine Hells.

Furthermore, they discuss the Fall of Flammenvielen, and learn from Bronwyn rumours that the largest prison in Flammenvielen seemingly just disappeared amidst the attack - a prison that held many members of the tiefling-ran drug cartel, The Blazing Rain, and members of the Keepers of the Iron Helm, a legion of nationalist military veterans turned vagabond.

The party eventually bid Bronwyn farewell and return to the inn for their final night of stay, reconvening with the injured Lorna, and settling in before their departure from town the following day.
