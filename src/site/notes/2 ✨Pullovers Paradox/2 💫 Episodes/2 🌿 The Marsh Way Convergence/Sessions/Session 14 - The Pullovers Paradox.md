# üî®Preparations at Little Thorn

The morning starts off as the party meet with the Licklittle amidst Little Thorn who have been preparing through the night for the battle. 

They are immediately met with the sight of Door and Davos, who have collaborated to build a ship named the S.S. Dandelion, named after Mama, for them to sail into Grafter's Hollow to bring the Licklittle's who come to fight. In the meantime, B makes some special bombs out of the sap previously acquired, and cinnamon granted from Xolo. Xolo spends time identifying (eating) the grafting ash that they acquired in the first expedition, and Ember gets swimming lessons from Nicholas.

Everyone gathers at Licklittle Hall for a final briefing, and then set out aboard the S.S. Dandelion.
### ü™° The Battle for Grafter's Hollow

After bringing the boat into position, the Licklittles begin their assault on the island, charging the S.S. Dandelion to the docking port and crashing it onto the short beach that leads up towards the hollowed out tree. 

Overhead, the Albarettas soar in, dropping bombs and artillery made by B and Door, bringing absolute ruin down on the Grafter's estate that spreads out past the tree. They descend upon the hollow then, some clashing with those Grafter's who fly, and others aiding the Licklittles on the ground assault. Meanwhile, Tarkus from the Clungwaters slowly crashes through the waters of the forest, looming over the hollow and latching onto and eating what stray Grafter's fly by as if they were flies.

Amidst the chaos, the party water-walk into the hollow and sneak into the mound through a tunnel burrowed by B. This leads into the armoury that B had wound up in previously, and they gather Lorna and Douglas' gear before moving onward. Here, they first break the prisoners out of the mound, sending them up to join in on the fight, and then head into the room where Sol was examining Lorna
#### ‚ùó Sol's Revelation and Lyra's Hex

Holding him at gunpoint, the party confront Sol and demand he release Lorna. Strangely, Sol appears to be ecstatic that the party have appeared, and hearing the battle overhead, exclaims that he cannot believe his theory has proven right.

Upon questioning what he means by this, Sol asks the party if they have ever felt or followed the sensation of a pull? Upon uttering the words, Lyra's arm seizes, and just like Lorna and Ember, watches as a sigil becomes branded onto her forearm. 

Realizing they must join the fight above, the party dismiss Sol for the moment once he releases Lorna from her magic shackles. Upon rising, Lorna nearly cries in appreciation for the party, and assures them that Sol protected her as best he could. They then gather themselves and ready up, heading out of the mound and into the battle that has been cascading overhead.
#### üï∑Ô∏è The Pullovers Vs Dr Richtor Mauer

The party run out into the chaos, as Licklittles clash against Grafters in groups, Albarettas soar overhead fighting relentlessly, guided by their leaders who too fight, the S.S. Dandelion shifts and convulses, awakening into a sentient moving ship directed by Door's magic, and Tarkus bounds overhead, looming over the whole battle. Lorna thanks the party again, and mounts Cartinho, taking Sol to safety.

Then, Richtor appears, flying in to witness the downfall of his empire. He spies the party, who he knows has orchestrated this, and descends upon them alongside his grafted guard dog, and attempts his revenge upon them for their meddling.

The fights brutally, cutting through them with his grafting sickle, seizing them with an array of magics that he wields from the countless appendages he has grafted onto himself, and directing his men and and creations to assist all the while. The party duck and dodge, combining their efforts with support from the surrounding leaders of the Marsh Way to overwhelm and overpower the malicious leader of the grafted faction. They fight on, and back Richtor up into the grafting chamber. However, in a last ditch act of spite, Richtor seizes Lyra and attempts to graft her with the haunted sickle. She barely escapes, and in a wreckless moment, B launces a bomb made from a Rolkenheim chaos gem previously acquired into the grafting chamber, and detonates it above the alter.

The bomb malfunctions, setting off a chain reaction with the piles of grafting ash in the sanctum. Thankfully, the malfunction lessens what would have otherwise been a devastating explosion, and instead is contained to in and around the tree itself, eviscerating everything inside, leaving a crater in its wake, and a deeply wounded party, and Richtor.

In the moments after, amidst the smoke, strings rise from the clamber of noise around as Lorna dashes back into the fight, bolstering the party with inspiration as she now uses her dissipating arm to form and play a violin. Alongside her, Melma darts into the fray with a now wingless Myron, who dashes in next to the party and seizes Richtor with a series of blows and slashes. Overwhelmed, Richtor is beat down until he has nothing left to give, and B finishes him off with a shot through the head, finally putting his reign across the Marsh Way to rest.

### üôå The Liberation of the Marsh Way

Desperate celebrations are cried out as the last of the Grafters are dealt with, and the standing Licklittles and Albarettas cheer out both in relief and joy for their victory, but also in anguish of their fallen friends.

Amidst the crater where the tree once stood, Melma turns to Myron and gets down on one knee, proposing to him, both a proposal of love and marriage, and of peace and allegiance between the clans. He accepts, and the place grows quiet as Caross of the Albarettas struts forward to confront him, but in a surprise to all, announces that Myron is 'adequate', and worthy of fostering the allegiance.

Joy and celebration breaks out, but not before attention is directed once again to Tarkus, the hulking frog that still looms above them all. Tensions rise for a moment, until he announces that he is finally full, as Tarkus explodes, causing hundreds of baby Clungwater toadlings to rain from the sky, revealing to all that his intent to consume was to birth forth a new generation of Clungwater spawn into the Marsh Way.

There is an immense sense of relief in the air, as the Licklittles, Albarettas, and Clungwaters all find themselves united with the scourge of the Marsh Way, be it the Grafters, or Mama, now finally put to rest. They gather themselves, and their dead, and head back towards Licklittle Hall - where they prepare for a wedding, and a funeral.
