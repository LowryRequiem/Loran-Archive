# ðŸ”Ž Sol's Explanation

The session picks up in the aftermath of the battle, as the factions gather themselves and prepare for the day ahead. Here, Sol reunites with the party, who have many, many questions.

He explains how he was adopted in Avantus, the city if invention, and that despite his apparent age, due to Avantus' magical, time-altering clock, he has lived double that of his actual age. 
### ðŸ”® Hexes

He explains that the sigils that have been appearing on the party, are Hexes, a new type of magical brand that has been appearing on people since the Fall of Flammenvielen. They grant new magical powers, unlike the magic that already exists through the manipulation of essence in the world.

He explains his theory, that those with Hexes are converging on one another, drawn to one another, or similar paths. That the pull that the party is following, is their fates being interweaved with one another, and others with Hexes. He calls this the Convergence Contingency - a principle that suggests that fate unfolds based on a series of convergences between those with Hexes.

He exclaims how what happened at Grafter's Hollow was a convergence, and that by holding onto Lorna here as long as he could, he hoped it would draw in other Hex users, and in that theory he was correct.

He tells how amidst the history of Rivelium, it has always been the important people who changed the world, and that now with the fore coming of Hexes and convergences, this might be shifting, as suddenly those not important are becoming intwined with important events - paradoxes.
#### ðŸ”¥ Richtor and the Everflame

Sol explains how Richtor was a Flammenvielen researcher who was exiled for the extremity of his ambitions. He acquired the grafting sickle from the College of Evos - a branch of researchers who attempt to manipulate the essence of beings through science and experimentation - and used it to enhance his form and gather followers desperate for power like himself. 

Sol was a travelling researcher when he was found and kidnapped by Richtor in order to advance his research, appearing desperate to become powerful enough to become a vessel that could harness the Everflame.

The party eventually leave Sol at the hollow where he wishes to continue his research into convergences, and leave him with a sending stone to contact them. He advises them that one of his ex-associates, Daniels, too researches Hexes, convergences, and paradoxes, and will possibly seek them out if they do continue onwards to Wallrun.
### ðŸŒ³ Back at Little Thorn

Afterwards, the party return to Little Thorn alongside all the others as they gather the dead and the fallen. Everyone has a much needed rest, divides up the loot acquired from the hollow, and decides where they shall head next.

Lyra in the meantime spends time to study her Hex, and discovers that it allows her to see the threads of fate - thin, golden threads that connect people to the things and actions that they are immediately engaged with. Using her Hex, Lyra is also able to move and manipulate these.
### ðŸ’’ Melma and Myron's Wedding

There is a buzz and excitement in the air as everyone gathers for the wedding of Melma and Myron. Xolo magically gives himself luscious hair, B wears a flower girl dress, and the party gift Myron a potion from the hollow that allows him to regrow his wings.

Together, the party assist in throwing a beautiful celebration. Little and B are the flower children, and toss petals about the place that light up the place with glittering fire as Lyra casts dancing constellations about the hall and Xolo and Ember gust a mystical wind about Melma and dazzle the place in sparks.

Lyra weds them, casting a marriage ceremony as B casts fireworks into the sky that spell 'Just married, Melma & Myron 4eva ðŸ’—'. Lyra delivers, as Caross puts it, a most adequate speech, and the hall breaks out into celebrations.

Lorna plays music for the ceremony as the Licklittles, Albarettas and the party break out into festivities and dances. Xolo teaches Caross and Lyra to dance, B breakdances while Ember beatboxes, and Little slap dances with B.

Soon, the festivities spiral as the Licklittles share their alcoholic marsh liquor with the procession, and everyone gets incredibly drunk and jolly. Melma whips out her marsh moss once again, and the party all get high together as the festival slips into night. Myron takes B flying through the sky, causing her to pee with fear over the celebrations, while Ember gets sick from drink and Lyra tries and fails to confiscate drink from Little.

Xolo gets Cartinho high by feeding him a joint, and he soon falls asleep.  

As the night stretches on, and the town folk find themselves exceedingly merry, Ember decides to toast the Licklittle's fallen brother, who fell fighting alongside Mama. However, she mistakenly calls him Jim Goose, thus reinforcing his legacy as the Licklittle whose name was forever forgotten.

The party eventually leads out to the S.S. Dandelion, which has now returned to being simply a boat, where Davos and Door are having some late night drinks, discussing if Davos might stay at the Marsh Way and help them rebuild. Melma, Myron and the party join them on the boat, alongside one of the long-neck geese, Marvin, who Xolo befriends. The night ends as the party lay wasted in the birds nest with the newly wedded Melma and Myron, and they share a final toast to the liberation and celebrations that they have brought forth. They each pass out in the birds nest, and rest easy knowing that at least for tonight, they have done a great thing, and that fate clearly has something instore for them.
