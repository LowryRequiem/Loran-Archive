# 🍃 The Marsh Way Chase

The session picks up as the party quickly kick into a chase after the grafted men who took both Xolo and Lorna. The party glide across the waters of the Marsh Way with Cartinho, following the grafters deeper into their territory, finding themselves surrounded by oil lanterns instead of the usual firefly jars.

They manage to rescue Xolo from the swimming grafter, however lose Lorna to the winged one. They gather their wits and head back, intending to interrogate one of the grafters who they managed to subdue with their own tranquilizer needle in the previous fight.
### 🐦‍⬛ Enter Myron

After picking up the unconscious grafter, and the rescued Licklittle child, the party head back to the mound where they had left Davos and the tortoises. However, Davos is gone, presumed to have sent for help after they never returned. 

Before they settle in for the night, a rustling in the trees stirs up as suddenly a black-feathered aarakocra dashes down to greet them. The blunt, stoic bird announces himself as Myron Albaretta, and reveals that he was sent for them by Melma - his lover. The party realize that Melma has been hiding this relationship from her family, and leave the Licklittle child to Myron to fly back to Melma. 
### 🗡️ Grafter Interrogation 

As the rest of the party head to sleep for the night, Lyra and Xolo take it upon themselves to wait for the grafter to awaken, and interrogate him for information. After enough time, the grafter awakens, breaking out of his binds and attempting escape. Lyra swiftly apprehends him, tying him up once more and siphoning what information she can out of him.

They learn that the grafters are a faction operating out of a corner of the Marsh Way known as Grafter's Hollow. There are about 120 of them, and they serve an ex-Flammenvielen researcher named Richtor. The group appear to be kidnapping those with inherent magic abilities or racial traits - grafting their appendages onto their own in order to take and use their powers. 

The party realize that this was the group who set up the blockade for the procession, and presumably kidnapped those part of the exodus in order to harvest them. 

The grafter reveals that Richtor started all this after getting his hands on a Grafting Sickle - an arcane tool invented by the College of Evos, who the party now believe to be behind the racial splicing experiments. 
### 🌲Return to Licklittle Hall

As morning arrives, the party return to Little Thorn in order to convene with Melma, and tell Mama Licklittle of the Grafters. To the party's shock, Mama gets in an argument with Melma over this, berating her, and remaining steadfast that the kidnappings are being carried out by the Clungwaters and the Albarettas. 

Even upon being presented with a grafter by the party, she uses her stick which commands the marsh to bind him with vines and drag him deep beneath the water, ignoring the party's pleas. 
#### 🌿 Meeting at Melma's

The party gather with Melma after their failed meeting, and realize that there is no getting through to Mama. Melma explains that herself and Myron had scoped out Grafter's Hollow, and that if they meet at Melma's place later, they can discuss a plan going forward. It's clear that while Melma was suspicious of the party at first, she now finds herself trusting them, and potentially needing them, to deal with this grafter problem.
