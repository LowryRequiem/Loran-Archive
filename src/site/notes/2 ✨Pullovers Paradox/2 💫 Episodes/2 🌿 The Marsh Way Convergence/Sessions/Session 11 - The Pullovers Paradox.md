# üö¨ Outside the Mound

After extracting what intel they could from observing Sol and the Grafters, the party attempt their escape. B burrows back out to Ember and Lyra who await in the trench, while Xolo awaits Polita's return, hidden beneath a parked cart.

Before they can slink away, the three in the trench suddenly hear Grafter's approaching, and conceal themselves with a silent image before realizing it's two Grafters who have come down into the trenches to slack off and smoke. Lyra attempts to slink off first, but trips, stumbling into them, and startling them to combat.
## Combat Start | Escaping the Hollow

The two Grafter's quickly shout and begin alerting others guards that there are interlopers. The party attempt to flee, clashing with the two Grafters in their way as others begin to rush to the mound. 

Xolo eventually catches up, but not before Grafters begin to surround the trench, tossing snares and sleeping mist to try and subdue the party.
### üï∑Ô∏è Enter Richtor

The party make a good effort fighting through the first wave of Grafters that attempt to subdue them, but are quickly met with more resistance as Richtor returns, flying from above and landing to discover what is causing the commotion.

He attempts to cut through the party using the grafting sickle, which makes quick work of Lyra's seemingly impenetrable armour, and blasting them with beholder rays. His power is immense, but the party and quick and nimble - Ember somehow managing to slip out of his grasp as he desperately slashes at her with the sickle, revealing how he is particularly interested in her because of her mark similar to Lyra's.
### üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ Myron's Sacrifice

Eventually, Myron flies in to provide support, fighting off some of the Grafters from the air, displaying his unique fighting style that allows him to elongate and harden his limbs into tree bark as he throws flying kicks and sweeps. It is barely enough however, and Richtor manages to clip his wings, capturing him as the party barely escapes. 

The party shake off the few Grafters who pursue them, and link back up with Davos and Cartinho who escort them back to Little Thorn safely. They are distraught at how overwhelming the Grafters are, and decide that if they have any hope to get Lorna, and now Myron back, they are going to have to bargain with the Clungwaters and the Albarettas, and negotiate some sort of peace between the marsh factions.
