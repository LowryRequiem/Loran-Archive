# ‚öîÔ∏è Battle at Licklittle Hall

The session kicks off as Mama Licklittle traps the party and onlookers inside Licklittle Hall - instructing her sons and husband to deal with the party alongside her. 

The battle swings into motion, with Mama using her whip-stick to shift the tree to her liking, embalming it in fog, healing from drinking it's waters, and loosing the lily pad flooring to trap the party in the viny waters beneath.

Meanwhile, Door uses his pencil-stick to animated wooden structures to life to distract and interrupt the party, Little darts around attacking widely with his log-stick, and John Roos lunges onto them violently with his duel wielded sickle-shovel-stick. Melma desperately fights alongside the party, dancing about on her floating lily pads and casting through her wand-stick to hold back her family best she can.

The party are forced to meet the Licklittle's onslaught with force, focusing all their efforts on taking down Mama while attempting to sway the others to stop fighting, who are clearly hesitant. John Roos however, is completely on Mama's side, and slashes at the party relentlessly until he is finally scorched down by Ember. 

In a moment which revealed to all Mama's true colours, while John Roos was down and dying, she instead continued to lash at the party and heal herself, allowing her son to fall. The incident shot through the Licklittle family, and acted as a turning point which saw Door and Little shifting sides, now working with the party to put Mama down at last, who is now gone manic with rage.

She struggles to a final breath on her knees, but is eventually smited by Lyra, who surrounds herself in a spirit shroud of lost Licklittle spirits, and disintegrates Mama with a blast of concentrated necromantic energy, wilting her away to a blighted, fungal carcass.
### üåø The New Head of the Licklittles

The onlookers rejoice desperately, released from the fear that Mama had bestowed onto them, now fully realized as they watched her descent into madness unfold. The party stand tall after their victory, turning to confront the clan alongside Melma, who delivers a speech to finally unite the Licklittle clan, and inspire them to come together to liberate the Marsh Way and find peace once more. She is raised as new head of the clan, approved by her father Door, and the Licklittles delve into the night in preparation for the battle that is to come the following day.
