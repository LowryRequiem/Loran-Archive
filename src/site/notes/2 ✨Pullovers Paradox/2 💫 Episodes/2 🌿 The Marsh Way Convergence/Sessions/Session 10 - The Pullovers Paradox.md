# üåøMeeting at Melma's

The session begins with the party gathering at Melma's place, a cutely decorated cosy shack in the middle of Little Thorn. The party reunite with Davos here, who lets them know he has spoken to both Melma and Myron. 

While waiting for the pair, Ember experiments more with the sigil on her hand, and discovers that it allows her to rewind flame, suddenly finding herself able to snuff out the candles lit around Melma's place.

During the wait, B works on some explosives with 'splody sap she bought from one of the townsfolk. The bomb goes wrong, is tossed and detonated in the water outside, and Xolo cooks one of the long-neck geese that died from the blast.

After some time, Melma and Myron return home, and discuss the situation with the party who ultimately decide to go and investigate Grafter's Hollow for themselves.
### ü™° Grafter's Hollow Expedition

The party head out towards Grafter's Hollow, taking some wooden rafts with them that they can use as to not lead Cartinho into harms way.

The party head back out to Grafter's territory, sneaking by patrolling rafts between hanging oil lanterns. Eventually, they reach Grafter's Hollow, a rugged, eery outpost built about a giant hollowed tree. Xolo uses Polita to scout the place out, and discovers their settlement built far behind the tree, a body disposal site near where the land meets the water, and a mound that the Grafter's appear to be shipping captives into.

The party sneakily bring their carts through the body disposal riverway, and sneak onto the island. They split up, with Xolo turning invisible and heading for the tree, B burrowing beneath the ground, and Lyra and Ember delving into a trench that leads around the back of the central tree.
#### üï∑Ô∏è Richtor and the Grafting Site

While the others explore the island, Xolo finds himself in the central tree. The place appears to be a cultist ritual site of sorts, with a sacrificial alter in the centre surrounded by piles of strange, teal-coloured ash. This is where the party assumes the grafting process takes place.

While scoping it out, Richtor, the leader of the Grafter's, enters. He is a hulking amalgamation of parts - devil arm, tiefling wings, beholder tendrils for hair, spider mandibles etc. He doesn't notice Xolo who is still invisible, and eventually leaves.

#### üîóThe Mound

Meanwhile, after scoping out one of the rooms beneath the tree, B returns to the rest and they devise investigating the mound. Lyra turns B invisible, and she enters through a hatch out behind the mound.

The mound appears to be where the Grafter's are storing their victims - with some being killed outside and led to body disposal, while the rest are escorting inside, presumably where they shall wait before being taken for grafting.

While exploring the chambers, Polita discovers a room where prisoners are being stored, and finds that Douglas and the rest of the party they had talked to in the procession are being held captive here, confirming their suspicion that the Grafter's were responsible for their disappearance. 
#### üî≠ Sol

B and Polita explore the rest of the underground chambers beneath the mound, and eventually happen upon a small office of sorts with a human researcher of sorts working away inside - Sol.

Upon entering, Xolo, through Polita, spies that Sol is examining an unconscious Lorna who is laid out across a table. Not before long, Richtor enters, and scolds Sol to work faster, revealing that whatever research Sol is doing, it will allow him to become a 'vessel'. 

Sol argues with Richtor, self-proclaiming his morals and revealing that he is being kept their by Richtor forcibly to carry out this research. Richtor threatens to start killing captive children each night that Sol doesn't make an advancement, and leaves.
