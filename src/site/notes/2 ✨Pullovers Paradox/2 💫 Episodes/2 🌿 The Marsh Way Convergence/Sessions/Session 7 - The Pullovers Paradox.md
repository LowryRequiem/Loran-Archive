# 🍃 Attacked by the Marsh

As the party gets the news of the missing procession, they continue to attempt to loosen their cart from the mutated fungi and vines that have seized it. Eventually, they take to try burning the flora off, but anger the vines and spores which they realize too late are sentient, and are thrown into combat with the surrounding vines and trees which attempt to stab and restrain them.
### 🕷️ The Cart Rises

Amidst the chaos, the party realize that the purple, mutating water has also affected the very cart that they had rode here, as it mutates itself, coming to life and becoming agitated by the party. 
### 🪵 Enter Little Licklittle

As the party fend off the marsh, a small, quick-footed elf child named Little Licklittle suddenly bounces into the fray along a wooden log that he appears to be able to submerge, and resummon from the mud of the marsh. 

Little quickly helps fend off the attacking flora, and attempts to settle down the now-sentient cart which appears to just be startled and scared. Xolo throws together some food for the cart, feeding and befriending it before naming it Cartinho.
#### 🛖 The Marsh Way

Little introduces himself to the party, and explains that he comes from the Licklittle clan, an expansive marsh-elf community that has set up in a town called Little Thorn along the Marsh Way. He warns of other enemy factions within the Marsh Way - the Clungwaters and the Albarettas. 

As the discuss, the party realize that they route they took into the marsh has become completely strewn with these mutated vines and trees, and decide that cutting through the Marsh Way would be an easier solution. 

Following the lead of Little Licklittle, they hop into their new, sentient, spider-fungus cart hybrid and ride off through the waters towards Little Thorn.
